## Constitution Compliance Check

**Initial Review** (Pre-Design)

- [x] Principle I: User-Centric Simplicity (simple "leftover" display, quick setup)
- [x] Principle II: Test-First Development (TDD mandatory per FR-003)
- [x] Principle III: Incremental Delivery (11 user stories P1/P2/P3)
- [x] Principle IV: Specification Before Implementation (spec complete, no [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers)
- [x] Principle V: Observability & Debuggability (FR-004: calculated vs user-entered values)
- [x] Principle VI: Build and Run Locality (Tauri desktop shell, no containers)
- [x] Principle VII: Portability & Compatibility (macOS, Windows, Linux support)
- [x] Principle VIII: Local File Storage (JSON files, user-owned backups)
- [x] Principle IX: More than Just a Spreadsheet ("leftover" calculation)
- [x] Principle X: Avoid Silly Libraries (no external UI frameworks, no Redux/Pinia)
- [x] Principle XI: Makefiles for Automation (build, dev, test, lint, format, clean)
- [x] Principle XII: User Documentation Conciseness (clear, focused spec)
- [x] Principle XIII: User Interface Consistency (consistent navigation, summary view)
- [x] Principle XIV: API Documentation (OpenAPI spec for IPC, no AI LLM generation)
- [x] Principle XV: No Containers (Docker/Kubernetes excluded)
- [x] Principle XVI: Bun Backend (native TypeScript, bun.serve(), localhost:3000)
- [x] Principle XVII: Backend Transparency (no user-facing logs, invisible data flow)
- [x] Principle XVIII: Tauri Desktop Shell (native WebView, IPC, <10MB total)
- [x] Principle XIX: SvelteKit Frontend (Svelte, Vite, <100KB gzipped)
- [x] Principle XX: Component Structure (single concern, props/events, $ for derived state)
- [x] Principle XXI: Reactive Declarations Over State Management (Svelte stores, no Redux)
- [x] Principle XXII: Code Organization & Documentation (logical sections, JSDoc comments)
- [x] Principle XXIII: Styling via Scoped CSS Only (no Tailwind/Bootstrap)
- [x] Principle XXIV: No External UI Component Libraries (build custom, semantic HTML)
- [x] Principle XXV: Tauri IPC Integration (commands, file access via Tauri)
- [x] Principle XXVI: AI-Readable Code Structure (descriptive names, comments on complex logic)

**Constitution Compliance**: ✅ ALL PRINCIPLES ALIGNED

**No Violations**: This project passes all 26 core principles. No violations or violations requiring justification identified.

## Implementation Readiness

**Phase 0 Status**: ✅ COMPLETE
**Phase 1 Status**: ⏳ READY TO START

**Remaining Blockers**:

- Complete Phase 1 (data model, quickstart, contracts)
- Generate Phase 2 tasks using /speckit.tasks command

---

## User Action Required

**🎨 FILL IN COLOR SCHEME**: Navigate to `spec.md` and fill in the `[TO BE FILLED IN BY USER]` placeholders in the Visual Design Requirements section (lines ~361-365 with 9 color placeholders).

**Once complete**:

- Run `/speckit.tasks` to generate implementation tasks
- Begin implementation (first user story: Setup/Onboarding)

---

## Notes

- Constitution alignment: Excellent - all 26 principles satisfied
- Architecture: Clean separation of concerns (Tauri shell, Bun backend, Svelte frontend)
- Data model: Complete with all entities, relationships, and validation rules
- Contracts: All major UI components defined with detailed specifications
- No violations or architecture conflicts identified
- Ready for Phase 2 (Implementation Tasks)
