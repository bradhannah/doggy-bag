description: Run tests with coverage reporting
---

Run `make test-coverage` to execute tests with coverage.

Report:

1. Backend coverage percentage (line, branch, function)
2. Frontend coverage percentage (if Node.js available)
3. Any files with coverage below 80%
4. Recommendations for improving coverage

Note: Frontend coverage requires Node.js installed. If not available, only backend coverage will be reported.
