description: Run all tests and analyze results
---

Run `make test` to execute all test suites (backend, frontend, E2E).

If any tests fail:

1. Identify which test suite failed
2. Show the specific failing test(s)
3. Investigate the cause
4. Suggest a fix

Report the final test counts and pass/fail status.
